# RandomizerTableTool
This tool allows custom tables to be made for randomized gameplay elements in tabletop games, like DnD, but can be extended anywhere custom random options or details may be desired. Inspired by tabletop games, dice rolls can be assigned to your inputs on the table, and an in app dice can decide which of your custom inputs is selected.
